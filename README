todoer is a simple tool for tracking todo items, primarily as a way
of experimenting with tsapp, but it is useful too. 

It simply creates appropriately tagged tiddlers and lists those that 
are there.

The hope here is that someone will see just how easy this stuff is
and make a good todo application, using modern JavaScript libraries
and skillz.
